Music-Tag version 0.23
============================

Extendable module for working with Music Tags. Is powered by various
plugins that collect data about a song based on whatever information
has already been discovered.  

This base package comes with the following plugins:

MP3 - Info from MP3 Header. Uses MP3::Info 
M4A - Info from M4A or M4P Header. Uses Audio::M4P at the moment.
FLAC - Info from FLAC Header. Uses Audio::FLAC::Header
OGG - Info from OGG Header. Uses Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl
File - Info based on filename
MusicBrainz - Info from MusicBrainz site. Uses WebService::MusicBrainz
Amazon - Info from Amazon site. Uses Net::Amazon
Lyrics - Quick and dirty lyric search. 

Other modules are easy to write, and in fact I have writen a few.

Music-Tag version 0.26
============================

Extendable module for working with Music Tags. Is powered by various
plugins that collect data about a song based on whatever information
has already been discovered.  

This base package comes with the following plugins:

MP3 - Info from MP3 Header. Uses MP3::Info 
M4A - Info from M4A or M4P Header. Uses M4P::Info and Audio::M4P::QuickTime
FLAC - Info from FLAC Header. Uses Audio::FLAC::Header
OGG - Info from OGG Header. Uses Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl
File - Info based on filename
MusicBrainz - Info from MusicBrainz site. Uses WebService::MusicBrainz
Amazon - Info from Amazon site. Uses Net::Amazon
Lyrics - Quick and dirty lyric search. 

Other modules are easy to write, and in fact I have writen a few.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

!!!!!!  IMPORTANT: If you have installed older versions (older than .25) 
PLEASE delete the following scripts from your bin folder: autotag safetag 
quicktag musicsort musicinfo.  If you used any of these scripts, create a 
symbolic link to musictag for each  !!!!!!

QUICK INSTALL OF DEPENDENCIES

This module builds on the work of others.  It has a lot of dependencies.
I encourage you to install this automagically with the CPAN module.  To
do this, run the following command:

   perl -MCPAN -eshell

At the cpan shell prompt type:

   install Text::LevenshteinXS
   install Text::Unaccent
   install Term::ANSIColor
   install Music::Tag

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Audio::FLAC::Header
   Cache::FileCache
   Encode
   File::Spec
   HTML::Entities
   LWP
   MP3::Tag
   MP4::Info
   Net::Amazon
   Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl
   URI::Escape
   URI::WithBase
   WebService::MusicBrainz
   Locale::Country

The version info in the Makefile is based on what I use.  You can get 
away with older versions in many cases. Do not install an older version
of MP3::Tag.

I strongly recommend the following to improve web searches:

   Lingua::EN::Inflect
   Lingua::Stem
   Text::LevenshteinXS
   Text::Unaccent 

The following just makes things pretty:

   Term::ANSIColor

NOTE ON ID3v2.4 TAGS

There seems to be a bug with MP3::Tag::ID3v2 0.9709. To use ID3v2.4 tags,
download MP3::Tag from CPAN and apply the following patch:

   patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

To do this change directory to the MP3::Tag download directory and type

   patch -p1 < ../Music-Tag/patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

Then install as normal

   perl Makefile.PL
   make && make test
   make install

NOTE ON OGG-VORBIS FILES

I have had trouble with Ogg::Vorbis::Header.  As such, I have stoped using it. 
I now use OGG::Vorbis::PurePerl. This module is also buggy, and doesn't have
write support.  To overcome this limitation, for now, I am using the
vorbiscomment program that is part of the vorbis-tools package from xiph.org.

I am planning on adding write support to Ogg::Vorbis::PurePerl someday.

USE

   musictag --help 
   musictag --longhelp

TEST FILES

Are based on the sample file for Audio::M4P.  For testing only.
